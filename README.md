The project works with data from themoviedb.org. 

I use these endpoints for the data: 
https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/tv/get-popular-tv-shows 
https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/tv/get-tv-details 

You can see popular TV shows and the detail of the TV show. You can add the TV show you like to your favorites.
